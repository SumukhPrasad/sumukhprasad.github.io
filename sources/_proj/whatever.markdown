excerpt: On creating interactive, engaging tools that inspire a lifelong love for learning and technology.

Just last Monday (20th November '23), we wrapped up this year’s block coding competition, BlockJam, at DPS Bangalore South. Writing the software and infrastructure for this event was an insightful experience. Designing software for kids requires careful consideration of their unique needs, abilities, and interests, and here’s what I learnt from the experience:

## Intuition 
User interfaces should be simple and intuitive. Interfaces should be understandable at first glance, and need to be unobtrusive to the task at hand. As Dieter Rams might put it: “Good design Involves as little design as possible.”

## Engagement 
Children learn best through play. Gamifying the experience is key to keeping kids interested. The thrill and excitement of finishing challenges one by one gives them the motivation to keep going.

## Colours 
Colours are a double-edged sword. On one hand, they can provide the intuitive hierarchy in UI and also serve to spruce up the visual appeal of the project, and on the other hand, not choosing your colour scheme wisely can be detrimental to the experience.

## Testing and feedback 
Regularly testing the BlockJam platform made a huge difference to how it otherwise might’ve played out. Seeing how children interacted with the software allowed the platform’s design to be adjusted and tweaked based on their behaviour. When the event commenced, the constant feedback from teachers and students using it at scale helped make the platform even more robust infrastructure-wise and more intuitive for children to use.

In designing software for kids and organising BlockJam, I've learnt that the key lies in blending education with enjoyment. Witnessing the enthusiasm and creativity of young minds reinforced the importance of creating interactive, engaging tools that inspire a lifelong love for learning and technology.
