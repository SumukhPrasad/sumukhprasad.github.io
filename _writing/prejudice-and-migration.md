_This is a story (including some variations or deviations present in some tellings) of Nacharamma, which has not been documented in any form of inscription, writing, or art, but rather has been orally passed on from generation to generation by the Sankethi community._

Nacharamma's story is one of rebellion and the desire for independence from prejudice. The story seems to be quite well-known among older generations, but as is tradition with oral traditions, it is not quite well-known today.

Nacharamma and her family lived in the town of Sengottai, now a town on the border between Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The town was intensely patriarchal — women were not even allowed to learn to read. She lived with her husband and son, but was destitute — her husband could not earn a living, and they were forced to live on the outskirts of the town. She had to resort to begging to make her ends meet — something that the townsfolk ridiculed her for — _after all, how could she, the wife of a Brahmin<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>, have fallen so low as to beg for food?_

One day, her family was visited by a sage who, pitying their condition, blessed them with a certain medicinal oil — although it was one which would have the effect of killing one, maddening another, and enlightening the third. They took the blessing, hoping that the boy would become enlightened. But lo — it was the boy who died, the husband who went mad, and Nacharamma who became enlightened.

> Some stories say that it was not a sage, but Nacharamma herself who obtained the medicinal oil after she performed a special ritual.

She was driven to jump into a well by these incidents, and was pulled out by the villagers the next day. Having emerged from the well, she set about spreading her knowledge and wisdom amongst the villagers, regardless of their gender or caste. Many were drawn to her teachings —  even learned priests went to her, for they had conceded in her wisdom.

> Some stories say that she was driven to jump into the well by the immense heat she felt after drinking the oil, others say that it was out of grief for her son. Some say that Shiva saved her from dying from the fall and gave her moksha.

The priesthood of the village was, however, unsettled by this. They attempted to put her down in debates and intellectual battles, but she proved her mettle repeatedly — man or woman, priest or commoner. Naturally, the well-to-do priesthood became jealous of her and hatched a plan to insult her. They suggested that she arrange a meal for the village in penance for her husband and son. As tradition dictated, they gave her a sari for the funeral. However, the sari had been laced with lime powder, which made the material slippery and prevented it from staying draped. It was not long before their plans came to the fore. While serving rice, the sari slipped down, much to the humiliation of Nacharamma.

> It is said that she immediately improvised a drape, knotting her sari in a way that has become a hallmark of the Sankethi community.

Outraged, she cursed the gathering of priests — they would have no children to continue their lineage. The youngest priest fell to her feet, begging for forgiveness. Nacharamma, moved by this act, forgave him on the condition that Nacharamma and her family would leave Sengottai in peace. Around a hundred families joined her in protest.

The route they took is not yet completely known, but looking at the dialect, one may assume a rough route through the Ghats into Kerala, up through Kodagu, settling in Kowshika, and further moving to settle in villages such as Periyapatna, Basavapatna, and Chilkunda. The dialect and cuisine bear traces of this migration. Having established a community, Nacharamma passed away, leaving her body on the banks of the Kaveri. 

In the following two centuries, a few hundred more families fled Sengottai, following a slightly different route and ending up at Bettadapura, forming a different dialect of Sankethi in the process. This group of Sankethis further settled in villages such as Rudrapatna, Ramanathapura, Agrahara, among others.

### Thoughts
Nacharamma's legacy serves as a reminder of the dangers we face if we allow history to repeat itself. The very evils she stood against — the stifling of knowledge, the oppression of women, and the hierarchies designed to keep the marginalized in their place — are unfortunately not very distant memories, and in some places, harrowingly, are not memories at all. Her story serves as a reminder that these evils can return with eace if we, as a society, become complacent. The Sankethi community was built on the strength of those who refused to accept the injustice she once faced. 

I believe that we can only truly honor her legacy and prevent the injustices she fought against from ever taking hold again, if we keep her story alive, not just in our minds but in what we do. Her story serves as a beacon — a reminder that even in the face of adversity, one individual's courage and will to do something is often enough to make a change.
