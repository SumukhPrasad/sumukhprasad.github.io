Boredom, not necessity, is the mother of invention (maybe, but probably not). Here's some poems to make that case.

### A Priest and Cobbler
I am a cobbler, you are a priest.<br>
Why must this be?<br>
Our bodies and minds are human,<br>
And yet we choose to be,<br>
Joined at the hip by humanity,<br>
Yet poles apart by bigotry.<br>
I did not choose to be a cobbler,<br>
Nor did you a priest --<br>
Yet we still confine ourselves,<br>
To ideas even time may not remember.<br>
<br>
Why must this be?<br>
<br>
<br>

### Brown
Brownies are divine,<br>
chocolate is delicious,<br>
and brunette locks shine,<br>
flowing in the wind.<br>
<br>
Coffee is warm,<br>
rich and bold;<br>
Cinnabons are fun,<br>
soft as velvet folds.<br>
<br>
Yet my skin -- it is brown.<br>
It must be hidden,<br>
not seen in town.<br>
<br>
<br>

### Wandering
In a park,<br>
on a bench,<br>
under the mistletoe I see:<br>
A shooting star<br>
flies by,<br>
and I make a wish --<br>
I shall see the mountains,<br>
I shall brave the seas,<br>
I shall go everywhere,<br>
the world will never leave me.<br>
<br>
But alas, my daydream is broken,<br>
when I hear the voice of my teacher --<br>
"Please pay attention."<br>
<br>
But tomorrow is another day,<br>
and I shall wonder once again.<br>
