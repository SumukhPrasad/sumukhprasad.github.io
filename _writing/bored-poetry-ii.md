Boredom, not necessity, is the mother of invention (maybe, but probably not). Here's some poems to make that case.

### Little Garden
I have a garden,<br>
small as it may be,<br>
I find it quite charming,<br>
a nice place to be.<br>
<br>
The royals delight<br>
in their long, stately rows.<br>
And the businessman too admires,<br>
the one solitary rose,<br>
his twigs seem to grow.<br>
<br>
I find it quite intriguing,<br>
that with all their wealth and all their power,<br>
their gardens cannot yield,<br>
one wild and unbridled flower.<br>
<br>
Their gilded rows are fine, I'm sure,<br>
yet they lack the untamed charm,<br>
of petals grown by the wild alone,<br>
safe to unfurl, unpicked by hands of harm.<br>
<br>
So I shall keep my garden,<br>
neither prized nor possession,<br>
all its weeds and critters,<br>
touch-me-nots and forget-me-nots,<br>
rose bushes and jasmine shrubs,<br>
odds and tangled tendril ends,<br>
and me.<br>
<br>
<br>

### Napkin Poem
Spilled coffee spreads,<br>
like the fleeting thoughts in my head,<br>
as a face in a car outside the window,<br>
whirrs past, leaving behind,<br>
a scribbled heart, a paper scar.<br>
<br>
<br>
