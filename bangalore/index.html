	<p>Bangalore — I've called this city home my entire life.</p>
	
	<p>Between its gardens and lakes, small shops and behemoth offices, Bangalore has a certain uniqueness to it — not its traffic, not its roads, not its tech parks, but rather its people. Mumbai's famous for Bollywood, Delhi's famous for its bureaucrats, Mysore for its royalty — but Bangalore has its people. From retired pensioners at Lalbagh to restless techies on MG Road, Bangalore's not a city that wears its identity on its sleeve, but rather, lets it settle quietly in the day-to-day lives of its people, who, like the weather, are ever-so-slightly unpredictable.</p>
	
	<p>It’s a city where the everyday moments — chai at the corner shop or a walk through Cubbon Park, rushing through <i>Namma Metro</i> gates or walking on a wide road somehow completely covered with a canopy of leaves — make it what it is.  This is the Bangalore I know, and the one I will always call home.</p>
